I have created separate projects for each challenge.
you can open them in Visual Studio.
set the project as Start up and run the project.

Challenge #1:
Simply run the project it will return you the list of numbers between 1000 and 3000


Challenge #2
Simply run the project with two parameters for input and output file; and it will do the job for example.
SortCRVData.exe random_data.csv result_data.csv 
will read the data from random_data.csv sort it out and write into result_data.csv file.


I have run this for both random and large data it works fine. 
But for really big data this need to be done in chunks; 
Option1:
let say you have million records you need to sort;
need to divide it into smaller which is possible for system to handle; let say 200 000 we can handle easily.
sort first 200 000 write it down to file
sort next  200 000 write it down to file
then next
Now we have 5 set of record sorted 
Next step is to compare and merge two sets in sorting order. 
..
..
after few iteration data will become sorted properly.

Option2:
Read Line by line and writh to file in sorting order.

1. read a line from input file and when writing to target file run an algorith to find a place where it need to be inserted.
2. read next line and find the place where it need to go.

contiue until end of file.
